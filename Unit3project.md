# Unit 3:Project (develop for client) 

# Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition
Because my client Bea uses her computer daily for years, she has files that use space on her computer. She wants to identify such files with a application, by file name, file size, file types, last updated date, date of the file created and file address. This is because the client does not want to delete any personal files that are kept on purpose. The application also requires a username and password to log in to insure private data can only be accessed by her.

## Proposed Solution
**Design Statement**
I will be solving my clients problem by creating an application that shows information of a file. To do so, I will create the function of the application with the Python3.9 programming language, and the visuals and interface with the client with kivymd. The data needed in this aplication will be stored in SQLite. Python3.9 is a programming language that is most common in the Finally, I will be using Kivy.md to create the log in screen which the client requires. 「２週間以内に要編集」

## Success Criteria

1.There is a log-in screen that requires a username and password to log in

2.Screen after the log-in screen shows **file names** of files in oldest Last updated date order

3.Screen after the log-in screen shows **file size** of files in oldest Last updated date order

4.Screen after the log-in screen shows **file types** of files in oldest Last updated date order

5.Screen after the log-in screen shows the **last updated date** of files in oldest Last updated date order

6.Screen after the log-in screen shows the **date of the file created** in oldest Last updated date order

7.Screen after the log-in screen shows **file address** of files in oldest Last updated date order
