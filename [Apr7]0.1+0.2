Why is 0.1+0.2 == 0.3 false for python?

Because of :binary represenation 

```py
0.1 is 0.100000000000005551112312578 when 
print(f"{0.1:.06f}")

0.2 is 0.20000000000 when 
print(f"{0.1:.06f}")

0.3 is 0.29999999999999 when 
print(f"{0.1:.06f}")

print(f"{0.1+0.2:.06f}") is
0.300000000000

binary_representation = struct.pack('>d', number)
binary_representation = 

```


therefore it is not the exact same
